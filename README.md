# Option 1 RAG model to improve search through inventory and help customers
Problem it solves: Mechanics looking for the right tool or part for a job as well as 24 hour customer support.

AI Solution: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that:

Answers questions like “What tool do I need to remove the front axle on a 2014 Mustang?”

“Will this tool work for a 2012 Chevy Silverado?”

“How do I remove a ball joint on a 2016 F-150?”

“I ordered the wrong part — can I exchange it?”

“What tool do I need to replace my fuel injector?”

Retrieves from manuals, internal guides, and online forums.

# Option 2 AI powered parts recommender system
Problem it solves: Customers often don’t know exactly what tool or part they need, especially for specific vehicles or repair jobs.

AI Solution: A recommendation engine that suggests compatible tools based on:

The user's vehicle (make, model, year)

The problem they're trying to fix (entered via keywords or a guided workflow)

Data needed: Product metadata, vehicle compatibility charts, user behavior.

# Some questions to ask
Do you get a lot of customer support queries that could be automated?

Are you satisfied with how your inventory is managed?

Do customers often ask which tool is right for their vehicle?

Would having visual search or a guided assistant increase conversions?
