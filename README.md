# Freedom Racing Gameplan

# Option 1 RAG model to improve search through inventory and help customers
Problem it solves: Mechanics looking for the right tool or part for a job as well as 24 hour customer support.

AI Solution: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that:

Answers questions like “What tool do I need to remove the front axle on a 2014 Mustang?”

“Will this tool work for a 2012 Chevy Silverado?”

“How do I remove a ball joint on a 2016 F-150?”

“I ordered the wrong part — can I exchange it?”

“What tool do I need to replace my fuel injector?”

Retrieves from manuals, internal guides, and online forums.


# Some questions to ask
Do you get a lot of customer support questions that could be automated?

Are you satisfied with how your inventory is managed?

Do customers or mechanics often ask which tool is right for their vehicle?

Would having visual search or a guided assistant increase conversions on your website?
