Do you manufacturer your own tools and parts?

We do not manufacture anything. We distribute products for many different manufacturers.

Do your tools and parts come with instructions?

Not usually. Most manufacturers do not provide instructions as they assume you have a shop manual or similar resource. If the manufacturer includes instructions in the box, we will be sure to send them with your item.

Do you save my information?

For your protection, we do not save any credit card information. If you

for an account our system will save your order history and address for you.

Can you send me a catalog?

We don't have a printed version but we're always adding new products to this on-line catalog.

What is the latest I can place my order and get it shipped out the same day?

This answer depends on how busy we are. On each product page you will see "Order now and have your package on

day month date, year

when selecting UPS Next Day Air". If that text lists the next business day, than we can still get it out the same day if you immediately place your order.

Can I set up an account?

Absolutely! If you

register

for an account our system will save your order history and address for you.
